=== Java-based container configuration



[[beans-java-basic-concepts]]
==== Basic concepts: @Bean and @Configuration

The central artifacts in Spring's new Java-configuration support are
`@Configuration`-annotated classes and `@Bean`-annotated methods.

The `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures and
initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. For those familiar
with Spring's `<beans/>` XML configuration the `@Bean` annotation plays the same role as
the `<bean/>` element. You can use `@Bean` annotated methods with any Spring
`@Component`, however, they are most often used with `@Configuration` beans.

Annotating a class with `@Configuration` indicates that its primary purpose is as a
source of bean definitions. Furthermore, `@Configuration` classes allow inter-bean
dependencies to be defined by simply calling other `@Bean` methods in the same class.
The simplest possible `@Configuration` class would read as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public MyService myService() {
			return new MyServiceImpl();
		}

	}
----

The `AppConfig` class above would be equivalent to the following Spring `<beans/>` XML:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<bean id="myService" class="com.acme.services.MyServiceImpl"/>
	</beans>
----

The `@Bean` and `@Configuration` annotations will be discussed in depth in the sections
below. First, however, we'll cover the various ways of creating a spring container using
Java-based configuration.

.Full @Configuration vs 'lite' @Beans mode?
****
When `@Bean` methods are declared within classes that are __not__ annotated with
`@Configuration` they are referred to as being processed in a 'lite' mode. For example,
bean methods declared in a `@Component` or even in a __plain old class__ will be
considered 'lite'.

Unlike full `@Configuration`, lite `@Bean` methods cannot easily declare inter-bean
dependencies. Usually one `@Bean` method should not invoke another `@Bean` method when
operating in 'lite' mode.

Only using `@Bean` methods within `@Configuration` classes is a recommended approach of
ensuring that 'full' mode is always used. This will prevent the same `@Bean` method from
accidentally being invoked multiple times and helps to reduce subtle bugs that can be
hard to track down when operating in 'lite' mode.
****


[[beans-java-instantiating-container]]
==== Instantiating the Spring container using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
The sections below document Spring's `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`, new in Spring
3.0. This versatile `ApplicationContext` implementation is capable of accepting not only
`@Configuration` classes as input, but also plain `@Component` classes and classes
annotated with JSR-330 metadata.

When `@Configuration` classes are provided as input, the `@Configuration` class itself
is registered as a bean definition, and all declared `@Bean` methods within the class
are also registered as bean definitions.

When `@Component` and JSR-330 classes are provided, they are registered as bean
definitions, and it is assumed that DI metadata such as `@Autowired` or `@Inject` are
used within those classes where necessary.


[[beans-java-instantiating-container-contstructor]]
===== Simple construction
In much the same way that Spring XML files are used as input when instantiating a
`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `@Configuration` classes may be used as input when
instantiating an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`. This allows for completely
XML-free usage of the Spring container:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
		MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);
		myService.doStuff();
	}
----

As mentioned above, `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is not limited to working only
with `@Configuration` classes. Any `@Component` or JSR-330 annotated class may be supplied
as input to the constructor. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyServiceImpl.class, Dependency1.class, Dependency2.class);
		MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);
		myService.doStuff();
	}
----

The above assumes that `MyServiceImpl`, `Dependency1` and `Dependency2` use Spring
dependency injection annotations such as `@Autowired`.


[[beans-java-instantiating-container-register]]
===== Building the container programmatically using register(Class<?>...)

An `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` may be instantiated using a no-arg constructor
and then configured using the `register()` method. This approach is particularly useful
when programmatically building an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
		ctx.register(AppConfig.class, OtherConfig.class);
		ctx.register(AdditionalConfig.class);
		ctx.refresh();
		MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);
		myService.doStuff();
	}
----


[[beans-java-instantiating-container-scan]]
===== Enabling component scanning with scan(String...)

To enable component scanning, just annotate your `@Configuration` class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.acme")
	public class AppConfig  {
    	...
	}
----

[TIP]
====

Experienced Spring users will be familiar with the XML declaration equivalent from
Spring's `context:` namespace

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<context:component-scan base-package="com.acme"/>
	</beans>
----
====


In the example above, the `com.acme` package will be scanned, looking for any
`@Component`-annotated classes, and those classes will be registered as Spring bean
definitions within the container. `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` exposes the
`scan(String...)` method to allow for the same component-scanning functionality:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
		ctx.scan("com.acme");
		ctx.refresh();
		MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
Remember that `@Configuration` classes are <<beans-meta-annotations,meta-annotated>>
with `@Component`, so they are candidates for component-scanning! In the example above,
assuming that `AppConfig` is declared within the `com.acme` package (or any package
underneath), it will be picked up during the call to `scan()`, and upon `refresh()` all
its `@Bean` methods will be processed and registered as bean definitions within the
container.
====


[[beans-java-instantiating-container-web]]
===== Support for web applications with AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext

A `WebApplicationContext` variant of `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is available
with `AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext`. This implementation may be used when
configuring the Spring `ContextLoaderListener` servlet listener, Spring MVC
`DispatcherServlet`, etc. What follows is a `web.xml` snippet that configures a typical
Spring MVC web application. Note the use of the `contextClass` context-param and
init-param:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<web-app>
		<!-- Configure ContextLoaderListener to use AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
			instead of the default XmlWebApplicationContext -->
		<context-param>
			<param-name>contextClass</param-name>
			<param-value>
				org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
			</param-value>
		</context-param>

		<!-- Configuration locations must consist of one or more comma- or space-delimited
			fully-qualified @Configuration classes. Fully-qualified packages may also be
			specified for component-scanning -->
		<context-param>
			<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
			<param-value>com.acme.AppConfig</param-value>
		</context-param>

		<!-- Bootstrap the root application context as usual using ContextLoaderListener -->
		<listener>
			<listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
		</listener>

		<!-- Declare a Spring MVC DispatcherServlet as usual -->
		<servlet>
			<servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
			<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
			<!-- Configure DispatcherServlet to use AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
				instead of the default XmlWebApplicationContext -->
			<init-param>
				<param-name>contextClass</param-name>
				<param-value>
					org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
				</param-value>
			</init-param>
			<!-- Again, config locations must consist of one or more comma- or space-delimited
				and fully-qualified @Configuration classes -->
			<init-param>
				<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
				<param-value>com.acme.web.MvcConfig</param-value>
			</init-param>
		</servlet>

		<!-- map all requests for /app/* to the dispatcher servlet -->
		<servlet-mapping>
			<servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
			<url-pattern>/app/*</url-pattern>
		</servlet-mapping>
	</web-app>
----



[[beans-java-bean-annotation]]
==== Using the @Bean annotation

`@Bean` is a method-level annotation and a direct analog of the XML `<bean/>` element.
The annotation supports some of the attributes offered by `<bean/>`, such as:
<<beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean,init-method>>,
<<beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean,destroy-method>>,
<<beans-factory-autowire,autowiring>> and `name`.

You can use the `@Bean` annotation in a `@Configuration`-annotated or in a
`@Component`-annotated class.


[[beans-java-declaring-a-bean]]
===== Declaring a bean
To declare a bean, simply annotate a method with the `@Bean` annotation. You use this
method to register a bean definition within an `ApplicationContext` of the type
specified as the method's return value. By default, the bean name will be the same as
the method name. The following is a simple example of a `@Bean` method declaration:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public TransferService transferService() {
			return new TransferServiceImpl();
		}

	}
----

The preceding configuration is exactly equivalent to the following Spring XML:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<bean id="transferService" class="com.acme.TransferServiceImpl"/>
	</beans>
----

Both declarations make a bean named `transferService` available in the
`ApplicationContext`, bound to an object instance of type `TransferServiceImpl`:

[literal]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
transferService -> com.acme.TransferServiceImpl
----


[[beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks]]
===== Receiving lifecycle callbacks
Any classes defined with the `@Bean` annotation support the regular lifecycle callbacks
and can use the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations from JSR-250, see
<<beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations,JSR-250 annotations>> for further
details.

The regular Spring <<beans-factory-nature,lifecycle>> callbacks are fully supported as
well. If a bean implements `InitializingBean`, `DisposableBean`, or `Lifecycle`, their
respective methods are called by the container.

The standard set of `*Aware` interfaces such as <<beans-beanfactory,BeanFactoryAware>>,
<<beans-factory-aware,BeanNameAware>>,
<<context-functionality-messagesource,MessageSourceAware>>,
<<beans-factory-aware,ApplicationContextAware>>, and so on are also fully supported.

The `@Bean` annotation supports specifying arbitrary initialization and destruction
callback methods, much like Spring XML's `init-method` and `destroy-method` attributes
on the `bean` element:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Foo {
		public void init() {
			// initialization logic
		}
	}

	public class Bar {
		public void cleanup() {
			// destruction logic
		}
	}

	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean(initMethod = "init")
		public Foo foo() {
			return new Foo();
		}

		@Bean(destroyMethod = "cleanup")
		public Bar bar() {
			return new Bar();
		}

	}
----

Of course, in the case of `Foo` above, it would be equally as valid to call the `init()`
method directly during construction:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {
		@Bean
		public Foo foo() {
			Foo foo = new Foo();
			foo.init();
		return foo;
		}

		// ...

	}
----

[TIP]
====

When you work directly in Java, you can do anything you like with your objects and do
not always need to rely on the container lifecycle!
====


[[beans-java-specifying-bean-scope]]
===== Specifying bean scope

[[beans-java-available-scopes]]
====== Using the @Scope annotation

You can specify that your beans defined with the `@Bean` annotation should have a
specific scope. You can use any of the standard scopes specified in the
<<beans-factory-scopes,Bean Scopes>> section.

The default scope is `singleton`, but you can override this with the `@Scope` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class MyConfiguration {

		@Bean
		**@Scope("prototype")**
		public Encryptor encryptor() {
			// ...
		}

	}
----

[[beans-java-scoped-proxy]]
====== @Scope and scoped-proxy

Spring offers a convenient way of working with scoped dependencies through
<<beans-factory-scopes-other-injection,scoped proxies>>. The easiest way to create such
a proxy when using the XML configuration is the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element.
Configuring your beans in Java with a @Scope annotation offers equivalent support with
the proxyMode attribute. The default is no proxy ( `ScopedProxyMode.NO`), but you can
specify `ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS` or `ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES`.

If you port the scoped proxy example from the XML reference documentation (see preceding
link) to our `@Bean` using Java, it would look like the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy
	@Bean
	**@Scope(value = "session", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)**
	public UserPreferences userPreferences() {
		return new UserPreferences();
	}

	@Bean
	public Service userService() {
		UserService service = new SimpleUserService();
		// a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean
		service.setUserPreferences(userPreferences());
		return service;
	}
----


[[beans-java-customizing-bean-naming]]
===== Customizing bean naming
By default, configuration classes use a `@Bean` method's name as the name of the
resulting bean. This functionality can be overridden, however, with the `name` attribute.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean(name = "myFoo")
		public Foo foo() {
			return new Foo();
		}

	}
----


[[beans-java-bean-aliasing]]
===== Bean aliasing
As discussed in <<beans-beanname>>, it is sometimes desirable to give a single bean
multiple names, otherwise known as__bean aliasing__. The `name` attribute of the `@Bean`
annotation accepts a String array for this purpose.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean(name = { "dataSource", "subsystemA-dataSource", "subsystemB-dataSource" })
		public DataSource dataSource() {
			// instantiate, configure and return DataSource bean...
		}

	}
----


[[beans-java-bean-description]]
===== Bean description
Sometimes it is helpful to provide a more detailed textual description of a bean. This can
be particularly useful when beans are exposed (perhaps via JMX) for monitoring purposes.

To add a description to a `@Bean` the
{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/context/annotation/Description.html[`@Description`]
annotation can be used:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		**@Description("Provides a basic example of a bean")**
		public Foo foo() {
			return new Foo();
		}

	}
----


[[beans-java-configuration-annotation]]
==== Using the @Configuration annotation

`@Configuration` is a class-level annotation indicating that an object is a source of
bean definitions. `@Configuration` classes declare beans via public `@Bean` annotated
methods. Calls to `@Bean` methods on `@Configuration` classes can also be used to define
inter-bean dependencies. See <<beans-java-basic-concepts>> for a general introduction.


[[beans-java-injecting-dependencies]]
===== Injecting inter-bean dependencies
When ++@Bean++s have dependencies on one another, expressing that dependency is as simple
as having one bean method call another:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public Foo foo() {
			return new Foo(bar());
		}

		@Bean
		public Bar bar() {
			return new Bar();
		}

	}
----

In the example above, the `foo` bean receives a reference to `bar` via constructor
injection.

[NOTE]
====
This method of declaring inter-bean dependencies only works when the `@Bean` method is
declared within a `@Configuration` class. You cannot declare inter-bean dependencies
using plain `@Component` classes.
====


[[beans-java-method-injection]]
===== Lookup method injection
As noted earlier, <<beans-factory-method-injection,lookup method injection>> is an
advanced feature that you should use rarely. It is useful in cases where a
singleton-scoped bean has a dependency on a prototype-scoped bean. Using Java for this
type of configuration provides a natural means for implementing this pattern.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public abstract class CommandManager {
		public Object process(Object commandState) {
			// grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface
			Command command = createCommand();

			// set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance
			command.setState(commandState);
		return command.execute();
		}

		// okay... but where is the implementation of this method?
		protected abstract Command createCommand();
	}
----

Using Java-configuration support , you can create a subclass of `CommandManager` where
the abstract `createCommand()` method is overridden in such a way that it looks up a new
(prototype) command object:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Bean
	@Scope("prototype")
	public AsyncCommand asyncCommand() {
		AsyncCommand command = new AsyncCommand();
		// inject dependencies here as required
		return command;
	}

	@Bean
	public CommandManager commandManager() {
		// return new anonymous implementation of CommandManager with command() overridden
		// to return a new prototype Command object
		return new CommandManager() {
			protected Command createCommand() {
				return asyncCommand();
			}
		}
	}
----


[[beans-java-further-information-java-config]]
===== Further information about how Java-based configuration works internally
The following example shows a `@Bean` annotated method being called twice:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public ClientService clientService1() {
			ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();
			clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());
			return clientService;
		}

		@Bean
		public ClientService clientService2() {
			ClientServiceImpl clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();
			clientService.setClientDao(clientDao());
			return clientService;
		}

		@Bean
		public ClientDao clientDao() {
			return new ClientDaoImpl();
		}

	}
----

`clientDao()` has been called once in `clientService1()` and once in `clientService2()`.
Since this method creates a new instance of `ClientDaoImpl` and returns it, you would
normally expect having 2 instances (one for each service). That definitely would be
problematic: in Spring, instantiated beans have a `singleton` scope by default. This is
where the magic comes in: All `@Configuration` classes are subclassed at startup-time
with `CGLIB`. In the subclass, the child method checks the container first for any
cached (scoped) beans before it calls the parent method and creates a new instance. Note
that as of Spring 3.2, it is no longer necessary to add CGLIB to your classpath because
CGLIB classes have been repackaged under org.springframework and included directly
within the spring-core JAR.

[NOTE]
====
The behavior could be different according to the scope of your bean. We are talking
about singletons here.
====

[NOTE]
====
There are a few restrictions due to the fact that CGLIB dynamically adds features at
startup-time:

* Configuration classes should not be final
* They should have a constructor with no arguments
====



[[beans-java-composing-configuration-classes]]
==== Composing Java-based configurations


[[beans-java-using-import]]
===== Using the @Import annotation

Much as the `<import/>` element is used within Spring XML files to aid in modularizing
configurations, the `@Import` annotation allows for loading `@Bean` definitions from
another configuration class:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class ConfigA {

	 	@Bean
		public A a() {
			return new A();
		}

	}

	@Configuration
	@Import(ConfigA.class)
	public class ConfigB {

		@Bean
		public B b() {
			return new B();
		}

	}
----

Now, rather than needing to specify both `ConfigA.class` and `ConfigB.class` when
instantiating the context, only `ConfigB` needs to be supplied explicitly:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigB.class);

		// now both beans A and B will be available...
		A a = ctx.getBean(A.class);
		B b = ctx.getBean(B.class);
	}
----

This approach simplifies container instantiation, as only one class needs to be dealt
with, rather than requiring the developer to remember a potentially large number of
`@Configuration` classes during construction.

[[beans-java-injecting-imported-beans]]
====== Injecting dependencies on imported @Bean definitions

The example above works, but is simplistic. In most practical scenarios, beans will have
dependencies on one another across configuration classes. When using XML, this is not an
issue, per se, because there is no compiler involved, and one can simply declare
`ref="someBean"` and trust that Spring will work it out during container initialization.
Of course, when using `@Configuration` classes, the Java compiler places constraints on
the configuration model, in that references to other beans must be valid Java syntax.

Fortunately, solving this problem is simple. Remember that `@Configuration` classes are
ultimately just another bean in the container - this means that they can take advantage
of `@Autowired` injection metadata just like any other bean!

Let's consider a more real-world scenario with several `@Configuration` classes, each
depending on beans declared in the others:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class ServiceConfig {

		@Autowired
		private AccountRepository accountRepository;

		@Bean
		public TransferService transferService() {
			return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);
		}

	}

	@Configuration
	public class RepositoryConfig {

		@Autowired
		private DataSource dataSource;

		@Bean
		public AccountRepository accountRepository() {
			return new JdbcAccountRepository(dataSource);
		}

	}

	@Configuration
	@Import({ServiceConfig.class, RepositoryConfig.class})
	public class SystemTestConfig {

		@Bean
		public DataSource dataSource() {
			// return new DataSource
		}

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SystemTestConfig.class);
		// everything wires up across configuration classes...
		TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);
		transferService.transfer(100.00, "A123", "C456");
	}
----

.[[beans-java-injecting-imported-beans-fq]]Fully-qualifying imported beans for ease of navigation
--
In the scenario above, using `@Autowired` works well and provides the desired
modularity, but determining exactly where the autowired bean definitions are declared is
still somewhat ambiguous. For example, as a developer looking at `ServiceConfig`, how do
you know exactly where the `@Autowired AccountRepository` bean is declared? It's not
explicit in the code, and this may be just fine. Remember that the
https://spring.io/tools/sts[Spring Tool Suite] provides tooling that
can render graphs showing how everything is wired up - that may be all you need. Also,
your Java IDE can easily find all declarations and uses of the `AccountRepository` type,
and will quickly show you the location of `@Bean` methods that return that type.

In cases where this ambiguity is not acceptable and you wish to have direct navigation
from within your IDE from one `@Configuration` class to another, consider autowiring the
configuration classes themselves:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class ServiceConfig {

		@Autowired
		private RepositoryConfig repositoryConfig;

		@Bean
		public TransferService transferService() {
			// navigate 'through' the config class to the @Bean method!
			return new TransferServiceImpl(repositoryConfig.accountRepository());
		}

	}
----

In the situation above, it is completely explicit where `AccountRepository` is defined.
However, `ServiceConfig` is now tightly coupled to `RepositoryConfig`; that's the
tradeoff. This tight coupling can be somewhat mitigated by using interface-based or
abstract class-based `@Configuration` classes. Consider the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class ServiceConfig {

		@Autowired
		private RepositoryConfig repositoryConfig;

		@Bean
		public TransferService transferService() {
			return new TransferServiceImpl(repositoryConfig.accountRepository());
		}
	}

	@Configuration
	public interface RepositoryConfig {

		@Bean
		AccountRepository accountRepository();

	}

	@Configuration
	public class DefaultRepositoryConfig implements RepositoryConfig {

		@Bean
		public AccountRepository accountRepository() {
			return new JdbcAccountRepository(...);
		}

	}

	@Configuration
	@Import({ServiceConfig.class, DefaultRepositoryConfig.class}) // import the concrete config!
	public class SystemTestConfig {

		@Bean
		public DataSource dataSource() {
			// return DataSource
		}

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SystemTestConfig.class);
		TransferService transferService = ctx.getBean(TransferService.class);
		transferService.transfer(100.00, "A123", "C456");
	}
----

Now `ServiceConfig` is loosely coupled with respect to the concrete
`DefaultRepositoryConfig`, and built-in IDE tooling is still useful: it will be easy for
the developer to get a type hierarchy of `RepositoryConfig` implementations. In this
way, navigating `@Configuration` classes and their dependencies becomes no different
than the usual process of navigating interface-based code.
--


[[beans-java-conditional]]
===== Conditionally including @Configuration classes or @Beans
It is often useful to conditionally enable to disable a complete `@Configuration` class,
or even individual `@Bean` methods, based on some arbitrary system state. One common
example of this it to use the `@Profile` annotation to active beans only when a specific
profile has been enabled in the Spring `Environment` (see <<beans-definition-profiles>>
for details).

The `@Profile` annotation is actually implemented using a much more flexible annotation
called {javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/context/annotation/Conditional.html[`@Conditional`].
The `@Conditional` annotation indicates specific
`org.springframework.context.annotation.Condition` implementations that should be
consulted before a `@Bean` is registered.

Implementations of the `Condition` interface simply provide a `matches(...)`
method that returns `true` or `false`. For example, here is the actual
`Condition` implementation used for `@Profile`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Override
	public boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) {
		if (context.getEnvironment() != null) {
			// Read the @Profile annotation attributes
			MultiValueMap<String, Object> attrs = metadata.getAllAnnotationAttributes(Profile.class.getName());
			if (attrs != null) {
				for (Object value : attrs.get("value")) {
					if (context.getEnvironment().acceptsProfiles(((String[]) value))) {
						return true;
					}
				}
				return false;
			}
		}
		return true;
	}

[[beans-java-combining]]
===== Combining Java and XML configuration
Spring's `@Configuration` class support does not aim to be a 100% complete replacement
for Spring XML. Some facilities such as Spring XML namespaces remain an ideal way to
configure the container. In cases where XML is convenient or necessary, you have a
choice: either instantiate the container in an "XML-centric" way using, for example,
`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, or in a "Java-centric" fashion using
`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` and the `@ImportResource` annotation to import XML
as needed.

[[beans-java-combining-xml-centric]]
====== XML-centric use of @Configuration classes

It may be preferable to bootstrap the Spring container from XML and include
`@Configuration` classes in an ad-hoc fashion. For example, in a large existing codebase
that uses Spring XML, it will be easier to create `@Configuration` classes on an
as-needed basis and include them from the existing XML files. Below you'll find the
options for using `@Configuration` classes in this kind of "XML-centric" situation.

.[[beans-java-combining-xml-centric-declare-as-bean]]Declaring @Configuration classes as plain Spring `<bean/>` elements
--
Remember that `@Configuration` classes are ultimately just bean definitions in the
container. In this example, we create a `@Configuration` class named `AppConfig` and
include it within `system-test-config.xml` as a `<bean/>` definition. Because
`<context:annotation-config/>` is switched on, the container will recognize the
`@Configuration` annotation, and process the `@Bean` methods declared in `AppConfig`
properly.

		// ...
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
In `system-test-config.xml` above, the `AppConfig<bean/>` does not declare an `id`
element. While it would be acceptable to do so, it is unnecessary given that no other
bean will ever refer to it, and it is unlikely that it will be explicitly fetched from
the container by name. Likewise with the `DataSource` bean - it is only ever autowired
by type, so an explicit bean id is not strictly required.

.[[beans-java-combining-xml-centric-component-scan]] Using <context:component-scan/> to pick up `@Configuration` classes
--
Because `@Configuration` is meta-annotated with `@Component`, `@Configuration`-annotated
classes are automatically candidates for component scanning. Using the same scenario as
above, we can redefine `system-test-config.xml` to take advantage of component-scanning.
Note that in this case, we don't need to explicitly declare
`<context:annotation-config/>`, because `<context:component-scan/>` enables all the same
functionality.

[[beans-java-combining-java-centric]]
====== @Configuration class-centric use of XML with @ImportResource

In applications where `@Configuration` classes are the primary mechanism for configuring
the container, it will still likely be necessary to use at least some XML. In these
scenarios, simply use `@ImportResource` and define only as much XML as is needed. Doing
so achieves a "Java-centric" approach to configuring the container and keeps XML to a
bare minimum.

		@Value("${jdbc.password}")
		private String password;

		public DataSource dataSource() {
			return new DriverManagerDataSource(url, username, password);
