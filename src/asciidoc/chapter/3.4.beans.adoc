[[beans-factory-scopes]]
=== Bean scopes
When you create a bean definition, you create a __recipe__ for creating actual instances
of the class defined by that bean definition. The idea that a bean definition is a
recipe is important, because it means that, as with a class, you can create many object
instances from a single recipe.

You can control not only the various dependencies and configuration values that are to
be plugged into an object that is created from a particular bean definition, but also
the __scope__ of the objects created from a particular bean definition. This approach is
powerful and flexible in that you can __choose__ the scope of the objects you create
through configuration instead of having to bake in the scope of an object at the Java
class level. Beans can be defined to be deployed in one of a number of scopes: out of
the box, the Spring Framework supports five scopes, three of which are available only if
you use a web-aware `ApplicationContext`.

The following scopes are supported out of the box. You can also create
<<beans-factory-scopes-custom,a custom scope.>>

[[beans-factory-scopes-singleton]]
==== The singleton scope
Only one __shared__ instance of a singleton bean is managed, and all requests for beans
with an id or ids matching that bean definition result in that one specific bean
instance being returned by the Spring container.

To put it another way, when you define a bean definition and it is scoped as a
singleton, the Spring IoC container creates __exactly one__ instance of the object
defined by that bean definition. This single instance is stored in a cache of such
singleton beans, and __all subsequent requests and references__ for that named bean
return the cached object.

image::images/singleton.png[width=400]

Spring's concept of a singleton bean differs from the Singleton pattern as defined in
the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns book. The GoF Singleton hard-codes the scope of an
object such that one __and only one__ instance of a particular class is created __per
ClassLoader__. The scope of the Spring singleton is best described as __per container
and per bean__. This means that if you define one bean for a particular class in a
single Spring container, then the Spring container creates one __and only one__ instance
of the class defined by that bean definition. __The singleton scope is the default scope
in Spring__. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you would write, for example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService"/>

	<!-- the following is equivalent, though redundant (singleton scope is the default) -->
	<bean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService" scope="singleton"/>
----



[[beans-factory-scopes-prototype]]
==== The prototype scope
The non-singleton, prototype scope of bean deployment results in the __creation of a new
bean instance__ every time a request for that specific bean is made. That is, the bean
is injected into another bean or you request it through a `getBean()` method call on the
container. As a rule, use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton
scope for stateless beans.

The following diagram illustrates the Spring prototype scope. __A data access object
(DAO) is not typically configured as a prototype, because a typical DAO does not hold
any conversational state; it was just easier for this author to reuse the core of the
singleton diagram.__

image::images/prototype.png[width=400]

The following example defines a bean as a prototype in XML:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService" scope="prototype"/>
----

In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a
prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a
prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype
instance. Thus, although__ initialization__ lifecycle callback methods are called on all
objects regardless of scope, in the case of prototypes, configured __destruction__
lifecycle callbacks are __not__ called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped
objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding. To get
the Spring container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, try using a
custom <<beans-factory-extension-bpp,bean post-processor>>, which holds a reference to
beans that need to be cleaned up.

In some respects, the Spring container's role in regard to a prototype-scoped bean is a
replacement for the Java `new` operator. All lifecycle management past that point must
be handled by the client. (For details on the lifecycle of a bean in the Spring
container, see <<beans-factory-lifecycle>>.)



[[beans-factory-scopes-sing-prot-interaction]]
==== Singleton beans with prototype-bean dependencies
When you use singleton-scoped beans with dependencies on prototype beans, be aware that
__dependencies are resolved at instantiation time__. Thus if you dependency-inject a
prototype-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean, a new prototype bean is instantiated
and then dependency-injected into the singleton bean. The prototype instance is the sole
instance that is ever supplied to the singleton-scoped bean.

However, suppose you want the singleton-scoped bean to acquire a new instance of the
prototype-scoped bean repeatedly at runtime. You cannot dependency-inject a
prototype-scoped bean into your singleton bean, because that injection occurs only
__once__, when the Spring container is instantiating the singleton bean and resolving
and injecting its dependencies. If you need a new instance of a prototype bean at
runtime more than once, see <<beans-factory-method-injection>>



[[beans-factory-scopes-other]]
==== Request, session, and global session scopes
The `request`, `session`, and `global session` scopes are __only__ available if you use
a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext` implementation (such as
`XmlWebApplicationContext`). If you use these scopes with regular Spring IoC containers
such as the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, you get an `IllegalStateException`
complaining about an unknown bean scope.


[[beans-factory-scopes-other-web-configuration]]
===== Initial web configuration
To support the scoping of beans at the `request`, `session`, and `global session` levels
(web-scoped beans), some minor initial configuration is required before you define your
beans. (This initial setup is __not__ required for the standard scopes, singleton and
prototype.)

How you accomplish this initial setup depends on your particular Servlet environment..

If you access scoped beans within Spring Web MVC, in effect, within a request that is
processed by the Spring `DispatcherServlet`, or `DispatcherPortlet`, then no special
setup is necessary: `DispatcherServlet` and `DispatcherPortlet` already expose all
relevant state.

If you use a Servlet 2.5 web container, with requests processed outside of Spring's
DispatcherServlet (for example, when using JSF or Struts), you need to register the
`org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener` `ServletRequestListener`.
For Servlet 3.0+, this can done programmatically via the `WebApplicationInitializer`
interface. Alternatively, or for older containers, add the following declaration to
your web application's `web.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<web-app>
		...
		<listener>
			<listener-class>
				org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
			</listener-class>
		</listener>
		...
	</web-app>
----

Alternatively, if there are issues with your listener setup, consider the provided
`RequestContextFilter`. The filter mapping depends on the surrounding web
application configuration, so you have to change it as appropriate.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<web-app>
		...
		<filter>
			<filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
			<filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.RequestContextFilter</filter-class>
		</filter>
		<filter-mapping>
			<filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
			<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
		</filter-mapping>
		...
	</web-app>
----

`DispatcherServlet`, `RequestContextListener` and `RequestContextFilter` all do exactly
the same thing, namely bind the HTTP request object to the `Thread` that is servicing
that request. This makes beans that are request- and session-scoped available further
down the call chain.


[[beans-factory-scopes-request]]
===== Request scope
Consider the following bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="loginAction" class="com.foo.LoginAction" scope="request"/>
----

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `LoginAction` bean by using the
`loginAction` bean definition for each and every HTTP request. That is, the
`loginAction` bean is scoped at the HTTP request level. You can change the internal
state of the instance that is created as much as you want, because other instances
created from the same `loginAction` bean definition will not see these changes in state;
they are particular to an individual request. When the request completes processing, the
bean that is scoped to the request is discarded.


[[beans-factory-scopes-session]]
===== Session scope
Consider the following bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>
----

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `UserPreferences` bean by using the
`userPreferences` bean definition for the lifetime of a single HTTP `Session`. In other
words, the `userPreferences` bean is effectively scoped at the HTTP `Session` level. As
with `request-scoped` beans, you can change the internal state of the instance that is
created as much as you want, knowing that other HTTP `Session` instances that are also
using instances created from the same `userPreferences` bean definition do not see these
changes in state, because they are particular to an individual HTTP `Session`. When the
HTTP `Session` is eventually discarded, the bean that is scoped to that particular HTTP
`Session` is also discarded.


[[beans-factory-scopes-global-session]]
===== Global session scope
Consider the following bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="globalSession"/>
----

The `global session` scope is similar to the standard HTTP `Session` scope
(<<beans-factory-scopes-session,described above>>), and applies only in the context of
portlet-based web applications. The portlet specification defines the notion of a global
`Session` that is shared among all portlets that make up a single portlet web
application. Beans defined at the `global session` scope are scoped (or bound) to the
lifetime of the global portlet `Session`.

If you write a standard Servlet-based web application and you define one or more beans
as having `global session` scope, the standard HTTP `Session` scope is used, and no
error is raised.


[[beans-factory-scopes-application]]
===== Application scope
Consider the following bean definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="appPreferences" class="com.foo.AppPreferences" scope="application"/>
----

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `AppPreferences` bean by using the
`appPreferences` bean definition once for the entire web application. That is, the
`appPreferences` bean is scoped at the `ServletContext` level, stored as a regular
`ServletContext` attribute. This is somewhat similar to a Spring singleton bean but
differs in two important ways: It is a singleton per `ServletContext`, not per Spring
'ApplicationContext' (or which there may be several in any given web application),
and it is actually exposed and therefore visible as a `ServletContext` attribute.


[[beans-factory-scopes-other-injection]]
===== Scoped beans as dependencies
The Spring IoC container manages not only the instantiation of your objects (beans), but
also the wiring up of collaborators (or dependencies). If you want to inject (for
example) an HTTP request scoped bean into another bean, you must inject an AOP proxy in
place of the scoped bean. That is, you need to inject a proxy object that exposes the
same public interface as the scoped object but that can also retrieve the real, target
object from the relevant scope (for example, an HTTP request) and delegate method calls
onto the real object.

[NOTE]
====
You __do not__ need to use the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` in conjunction with beans that are
scoped as `singletons` or `prototypes`.
====

The configuration in the following example is only one line, but it is important to
understand the "why" as well as the "how" behind it.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

		<!-- an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy -->
		<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session">
			<!-- instructs the container to proxy the surrounding bean -->
			<aop:scoped-proxy/>
		</bean>

		<!-- a singleton-scoped bean injected with a proxy to the above bean -->
		<bean id="userService" class="com.foo.SimpleUserService">
			<!-- a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean -->
			<property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
		</bean>
	</beans>
----

To create such a proxy, you insert a child `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element into a scoped
bean definition. See <<beans-factory-scopes-other-injection-proxies>> and
<<xsd-config>>.) Why do definitions of beans scoped at the `request`, `session`,
`globalSession` and custom-scope levels require the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element ?
Let's examine the following singleton bean definition and contrast it with what you need
to define for the aforementioned scopes. (The following `userPreferences` bean
definition as it stands is __incomplete.)__

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>

	<bean id="userManager" class="com.foo.UserManager">
		<property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
	</bean>
----

In the preceding example, the singleton bean `userManager` is injected with a reference
to the HTTP `Session`-scoped bean `userPreferences`. The salient point here is that the
`userManager` bean is a singleton: it will be instantiated __exactly once__ per
container, and its dependencies (in this case only one, the `userPreferences` bean) are
also injected only once. This means that the `userManager` bean will only operate on the
exact same `userPreferences` object, that is, the one that it was originally injected
with.

This is __not__ the behavior you want when injecting a shorter-lived scoped bean into a
longer-lived scoped bean, for example injecting an HTTP `Session`-scoped collaborating
bean as a dependency into singleton bean. Rather, you need a single `userManager`
object, and for the lifetime of an HTTP `Session`, you need a `userPreferences` object
that is specific to said HTTP `Session`. Thus the container creates an object that
exposes the exact same public interface as the `UserPreferences` class (ideally an
object that __is a__ `UserPreferences` instance) which can fetch the real
`UserPreferences` object from the scoping mechanism (HTTP request, `Session`, etc.). The
container injects this proxy object into the `userManager` bean, which is unaware that
this `UserPreferences` reference is a proxy. In this example, when a `UserManager`
instance invokes a method on the dependency-injected `UserPreferences` object, it
actually is invoking a method on the proxy. The proxy then fetches the real
`UserPreferences` object from (in this case) the HTTP `Session`, and delegates the
method invocation onto the retrieved real `UserPreferences` object.

Thus you need the following, correct and complete, configuration when injecting
`request-`, `session-`, and `globalSession-scoped` beans into collaborating objects:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session">
		<aop:scoped-proxy/>
	</bean>
	<bean id="userManager" class="com.foo.UserManager">
		<property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
	</bean>
----

[[beans-factory-scopes-other-injection-proxies]]
====== Choosing the type of proxy to create
By default, when the Spring container creates a proxy for a bean that is marked up with
the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element, __a CGLIB-based class proxy is created__.

[NOTE]
====
CGLIB proxies only intercept public method calls! Do not call non-public methods
on such a proxy; they will not be delegated to the actual scoped target object.
====

Alternatively, you can configure the Spring container to create standard JDK
interface-based proxies for such scoped beans, by specifying `false` for the value of
the `proxy-target-class` attribute of the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element. Using JDK
interface-based proxies means that you do not need additional libraries in your
application classpath to effect such proxying. However, it also means that the class of
the scoped bean must implement at least one interface, and __that all__ collaborators
into which the scoped bean is injected must reference the bean through one of its
interfaces.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<!-- DefaultUserPreferences implements the UserPreferences interface -->
	<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.DefaultUserPreferences" scope="session">
		<aop:scoped-proxy proxy-target-class="false"/>
	</bean>
	<bean id="userManager" class="com.foo.UserManager">
		<property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
	</bean>
----

For more detailed information about choosing class-based or interface-based proxying,
see <<aop-proxying>>.



[[beans-factory-scopes-custom]]
==== Custom scopes
The bean scoping mechanism is extensible; You can define your own
scopes, or even redefine existing scopes, although the latter is considered bad practice
and you __cannot__ override the built-in `singleton` and `prototype` scopes.


[[beans-factory-scopes-custom-creating]]
===== Creating a custom scope
To integrate your custom scope(s) into the Spring container, you need to implement the
`org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope` interface, which is described in this
section. For an idea of how to implement your own scopes, see the `Scope`
implementations that are supplied with the Spring Framework itself and the
{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/Scope.html[`Scope` javadocs],
which explains the methods you need to implement in more detail.

The `Scope` interface has four methods to get objects from the scope, remove them from
the scope, and allow them to be destroyed.

The following method returns the object from the underlying scope. The session scope
implementation, for example, returns the session-scoped bean (and if it does not exist,
the method returns a new instance of the bean, after having bound it to the session for
future reference).

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Object get(String name, ObjectFactory objectFactory)
----

The following method removes the object from the underlying scope. The session scope
implementation for example, removes the session-scoped bean from the underlying session.
The object should be returned, but you can return null if the object with the specified
name is not found.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Object remove(String name)
----

The following method registers the callbacks the scope should execute when it is
destroyed or when the specified object in the scope is destroyed. Refer to the javadocs
or a Spring scope implementation for more information on destruction callbacks.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	void registerDestructionCallback(String name, Runnable destructionCallback)
----

The following method obtains the conversation identifier for the underlying scope. This
identifier is different for each scope. For a session scoped implementation, this
identifier can be the session identifier.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String getConversationId()
----


[[beans-factory-scopes-custom-using]]
===== Using a custom scope
After you write and test one or more custom `Scope` implementations, you need to make
the Spring container aware of your new scope(s). The following method is the central
method to register a new `Scope` with the Spring container:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	void registerScope(String scopeName, Scope scope);
----

This method is declared on the `ConfigurableBeanFactory` interface, which is available
on most of the concrete `ApplicationContext` implementations that ship with Spring via
the BeanFactory property.

The first argument to the `registerScope(..)` method is the unique name associated with
a scope; examples of such names in the Spring container itself are `singleton` and
`prototype`. The second argument to the `registerScope(..)` method is an actual instance
of the custom `Scope` implementation that you wish to register and use.

Suppose that you write your custom `Scope` implementation, and then register it as below.

[NOTE]
====
The example below uses `SimpleThreadScope` which is included with Spring, but not
registered by default. The instructions would be the same for your own custom `Scope`
implementations.
====

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Scope threadScope = new SimpleThreadScope();
	beanFactory.registerScope("thread", threadScope);
----

You then create bean definitions that adhere to the scoping rules of your custom `Scope`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="..." class="..." scope="thread">
----

With a custom `Scope` implementation, you are not limited to programmatic registration
of the scope. You can also do the `Scope` registration declaratively, using the
`CustomScopeConfigurer` class:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

		<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomScopeConfigurer">
			<property name="scopes">
				<map>
					<entry key="thread">
						<bean class="org.springframework.context.support.SimpleThreadScope"/>
					</entry>
				</map>
			</property>
		</bean>

		<bean id="bar" class="x.y.Bar" scope="thread">
			<property name="name" value="Rick"/>
			<aop:scoped-proxy/>
		</bean>

		<bean id="foo" class="x.y.Foo">
			<property name="bar" ref="bar"/>
		</bean>

	</beans>
----

[NOTE]
====
When you place `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` in a `FactoryBean` implementation, it is the factory
bean itself that is scoped, not the object returned from `getObject()`.
====
