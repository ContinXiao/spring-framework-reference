=== Customizing the nature of a bean



[[beans-factory-lifecycle]]
==== Lifecycle callbacks
To interact with the container's management of the bean lifecycle, you can implement the
Spring `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces. The container calls
`afterPropertiesSet()` for the former and `destroy()` for the latter to allow the bean
to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction of your beans.

[TIP]
====

The JSR-250 `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations are generally considered best
practice for receiving lifecycle callbacks in a modern Spring application. Using these
annotations means that your beans are not coupled to Spring specific interfaces. For
details see <<beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations>>.

If you don't want to use the JSR-250 annotations but you are still looking to remove
coupling consider the use of init-method and destroy-method object definition metadata.
====

Internally, the Spring Framework uses `BeanPostProcessor` implementations to process any
callback interfaces it can find and call the appropriate methods. If you need custom
features or other lifecycle behavior Spring does not offer out-of-the-box, you can
implement a `BeanPostProcessor` yourself. For more information, see
<<beans-factory-extension>>.

In addition to the initialization and destruction callbacks, Spring-managed objects may
also implement the `Lifecycle` interface so that those objects can participate in the
startup and shutdown process as driven by the container's own lifecycle.

The lifecycle callback interfaces are described in this section.


[[beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean]]
===== Initialization callbacks
The `org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean` interface allows a bean to
perform initialization work after all necessary properties on the bean have been set by
the container. The `InitializingBean` interface specifies a single method:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception;
----

It is recommended that you do not use the `InitializingBean` interface because it
unnecessarily couples the code to Spring. Alternatively, use
the <<beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations, `@PostConstruct`>> annotation or
specify a POJO initialization method. In the case of XML-based configuration metadata,
you use the `init-method` attribute to specify the name of the method that has a void
no-argument signature. For example, the following definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="exampleInitBean" class="examples.ExampleBean" init-method="init"/>
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class ExampleBean {

		public void init() {
			// do some initialization work
		}

	}
----

...is exactly the same as...

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="exampleInitBean" class="examples.AnotherExampleBean"/>
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class AnotherExampleBean implements InitializingBean {

		public void afterPropertiesSet() {
			// do some initialization work
		}

	}
----

but does not couple the code to Spring.


[[beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean]]
===== Destruction callbacks
Implementing the `org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean` interface allows a
bean to get a callback when the container containing it is destroyed. The
`DisposableBean` interface specifies a single method:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	void destroy() throws Exception;
----

It is recommended that you do not use the `DisposableBean` callback interface because it
unnecessarily couples the code to Spring. Alternatively, use
the <<beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations, `@PreDestroy`>> annotation or
specify a generic method that is supported by bean definitions. With XML-based
configuration metadata, you use the `destroy-method` attribute on the `<bean/>`. For
example, the following definition:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="exampleInitBean" class="examples.ExampleBean" destroy-method="cleanup"/>
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class ExampleBean {

		public void cleanup() {
			// do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)
		}

	}
----

is exactly the same as:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="exampleInitBean" class="examples.AnotherExampleBean"/>
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class AnotherExampleBean implements DisposableBean {

		public void destroy() {
			// do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)
		}

	}
----

but does not couple the code to Spring.


[[beans-factory-lifecycle-default-init-destroy-methods]]
===== Default initialization and destroy methods
When you write initialization and destroy method callbacks that do not use the
Spring-specific `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` callback interfaces, you
typically write methods with names such as `init()`, `initialize()`, `dispose()`, and so
on. Ideally, the names of such lifecycle callback methods are standardized across a
project so that all developers use the same method names and ensure consistency.

You can configure the Spring container to `look` for named initialization and destroy
callback method names on __every__ bean. This means that you, as an application
developer, can write your application classes and use an initialization callback called
`init()`, without having to configure an `init-method="init"` attribute with each bean
definition. The Spring IoC container calls that method when the bean is created (and in
accordance with the standard lifecycle callback contract described previously). This
feature also enforces a consistent naming convention for initialization and destroy
method callbacks.

Suppose that your initialization callback methods are named `init()` and destroy
callback methods are named `destroy()`. Your class will resemble the class in the
following example.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class DefaultBlogService implements BlogService {

		private BlogDao blogDao;

		public void setBlogDao(BlogDao blogDao) {
			this.blogDao = blogDao;
		}

		// this is (unsurprisingly) the initialization callback method
		public void init() {
			if (this.blogDao == null) {
				throw new IllegalStateException("The [blogDao] property must be set.");
			}
		}

	}
----

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans default-init-method="init">

		<bean id="blogService" class="com.foo.DefaultBlogService">
			<property name="blogDao" ref="blogDao" />
		</bean>

	</beans>
----

The presence of the `default-init-method` attribute on the top-level `<beans/>` element
attribute causes the Spring IoC container to recognize a method called `init` on beans
as the initialization method callback. When a bean is created and assembled, if the bean
class has such a method, it is invoked at the appropriate time.

You configure destroy method callbacks similarly (in XML, that is) by using the
`default-destroy-method` attribute on the top-level `<beans/>` element.

Where existing bean classes already have callback methods that are named at variance
with the convention, you can override the default by specifying (in XML, that is) the
method name using the `init-method` and `destroy-method` attributes of the <bean/>
itself.

The Spring container guarantees that a configured initialization callback is called
immediately after a bean is supplied with all dependencies. Thus the initialization
callback is called on the raw bean reference, which means that AOP interceptors and so
forth are not yet applied to the bean. A target bean is fully created __first__,
__then__ an AOP proxy (for example) with its interceptor chain is applied. If the target
bean and the proxy are defined separately, your code can even interact with the raw
target bean, bypassing the proxy. Hence, it would be inconsistent to apply the
interceptors to the init method, because doing so would couple the lifecycle of the
target bean with its proxy/interceptors and leave strange semantics when your code
interacts directly to the raw target bean.


[[beans-factory-lifecycle-combined-effects]]
===== Combining lifecycle mechanisms
As of Spring 2.5, you have three options for controlling bean lifecycle behavior: the
<<beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean, `InitializingBean`>> and
<<beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean, `DisposableBean`>> callback interfaces; custom
`init()` and `destroy()` methods; and the
<<beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations, `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`
annotations>>. You can combine these mechanisms to control a given bean.

[NOTE]
====
If multiple lifecycle mechanisms are configured for a bean, and each mechanism is
configured with a different method name, then each configured method is executed in the
order listed below. However, if the same method name is configured - for example,
`init()` for an initialization method - for more than one of these lifecycle mechanisms,
that method is executed once, as explained in the preceding section.
====

Multiple lifecycle mechanisms configured for the same bean, with different
initialization methods, are called as follows:

* Methods annotated with `@PostConstruct`
* `afterPropertiesSet()` as defined by the `InitializingBean` callback interface
* A custom configured `init()` method

Destroy methods are called in the same order:

* Methods annotated with `@PreDestroy`
* `destroy()` as defined by the `DisposableBean` callback interface
* A custom configured `destroy()` method


[[beans-factory-lifecycle-processor]]
===== Startup and shutdown callbacks
The `Lifecycle` interface defines the essential methods for any object that has its own
lifecycle requirements (e.g. starts and stops some background process):

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface Lifecycle {

		void start();

		void stop();

		boolean isRunning();

	}
----

Any Spring-managed object may implement that interface. Then, when the
`ApplicationContext` itself starts and stops, it will cascade those calls to all `Lifecycle`
implementations defined within that context. It does this by delegating to a
`LifecycleProcessor`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface LifecycleProcessor extends Lifecycle {

		void onRefresh();

		void onClose();

	}
----

Notice that the `LifecycleProcessor` is itself an extension of the `Lifecycle`
interface. It also adds two other methods for reacting to the context being refreshed
and closed.

The order of startup and shutdown invocations can be important. If a "depends-on"
relationship exists between any two objects, the dependent side will start __after__ its
dependency, and it will stop __before__ its dependency. However, at times the direct
dependencies are unknown. You may only know that objects of a certain type should start
prior to objects of another type. In those cases, the `SmartLifecycle` interface defines
another option, namely the `getPhase()` method as defined on its super-interface,
`Phased`.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface Phased {

		int getPhase();

	}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface SmartLifecycle extends Lifecycle, Phased {

		boolean isAutoStartup();

		void stop(Runnable callback);

	}
----

When starting, the objects with the lowest phase start first, and when stopping, the
reverse order is followed. Therefore, an object that implements `SmartLifecycle` and
whose `getPhase()` method returns `Integer.MIN_VALUE` would be among the first to start
and the last to stop. At the other end of the spectrum, a phase value of
`Integer.MAX_VALUE` would indicate that the object should be started last and stopped
first (likely because it depends on other processes to be running). When considering the
phase value, it's also important to know that the default phase for any "normal"
`Lifecycle` object that does not implement `SmartLifecycle` would be 0. Therefore, any
negative phase value would indicate that an object should start before those standard
components (and stop after them), and vice versa for any positive phase value.

As you can see the stop method defined by `SmartLifecycle` accepts a callback. Any
implementation __must__ invoke that callback's `run()` method after that implementation's
shutdown process is complete. That enables asynchronous shutdown where necessary since
the default implementation of the `LifecycleProcessor` interface,
`DefaultLifecycleProcessor`, will wait up to its timeout value for the group of objects
within each phase to invoke that callback. The default per-phase timeout is 30 seconds.
You can override the default lifecycle processor instance by defining a bean named
"lifecycleProcessor" within the context. If you only want to modify the timeout, then
defining the following would be sufficient:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="lifecycleProcessor" class="org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor">
		<!-- timeout value in milliseconds -->
		<property name="timeoutPerShutdownPhase" value="10000"/>
	</bean>
----

As mentioned, the `LifecycleProcessor` interface defines callback methods for the
refreshing and closing of the context as well. The latter will simply drive the shutdown
process as if `stop()` had been called explicitly, but it will happen when the context is
closing. The 'refresh' callback on the other hand enables another feature of
`SmartLifecycle` beans. When the context is refreshed (after all objects have been
instantiated and initialized), that callback will be invoked, and at that point the
default lifecycle processor will check the boolean value returned by each
`SmartLifecycle` object's `isAutoStartup()` method. If "true", then that object will be
started at that point rather than waiting for an explicit invocation of the context's or
its own `start()` method (unlike the context refresh, the context start does not happen
automatically for a standard context implementation). The "phase" value as well as any
"depends-on" relationships will determine the startup order in the same way as described
above.


[[beans-factory-shutdown]]
===== Shutting down the Spring IoC container gracefully in non-web applications
[NOTE]
====
This section applies only to non-web applications. Spring's web-based
`ApplicationContext` implementations already have code in place to shut down the Spring
IoC container gracefully when the relevant web application is shut down.
====

If you are using Spring's IoC container in a non-web application environment; for
example, in a rich client desktop environment; you register a shutdown hook with the
JVM. Doing so ensures a graceful shutdown and calls the relevant destroy methods on your
singleton beans so that all resources are released. Of course, you must still configure
and implement these destroy callbacks correctly.

To register a shutdown hook, you call the `registerShutdownHook()` method that is
declared on the `AbstractApplicationContext` class:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	import org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext;
	import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

	public final class Boot {

		public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {

			AbstractApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
					new String []{"beans.xml"});

			// add a shutdown hook for the above context...
			ctx.registerShutdownHook();

			// app runs here...

			// main method exits, hook is called prior to the app shutting down...

		}
	}
----



[[beans-factory-aware]]
==== ApplicationContextAware and BeanNameAware

When an `ApplicationContext` creates an object instance that implements the
`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware` interface, the instance is provided
with a reference to that `ApplicationContext`.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface ApplicationContextAware {

		void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException;

	}
----

Thus beans can manipulate programmatically the `ApplicationContext` that created them,
through the `ApplicationContext` interface, or by casting the reference to a known
subclass of this interface, such as `ConfigurableApplicationContext`, which exposes
additional functionality. One use would be the programmatic retrieval of other beans.
Sometimes this capability is useful; however, in general you should avoid it, because it
couples the code to Spring and does not follow the Inversion of Control style, where
collaborators are provided to beans as properties. Other methods of the
`ApplicationContext` provide access to file resources, publishing application events, and
accessing a `MessageSource`. These additional features are described in
<<context-introduction>>

As of Spring 2.5, autowiring is another alternative to obtain reference to the
`ApplicationContext`. The "traditional" `constructor` and `byType` autowiring modes (as
described in <<beans-factory-autowire>>) can provide a dependency of type
`ApplicationContext` for a constructor argument or setter method parameter,
respectively. For more flexibility, including the ability to autowire fields and
multiple parameter methods, use the new annotation-based autowiring features. If you do,
the `ApplicationContext` is autowired into a field, constructor argument, or method
parameter that is expecting the `ApplicationContext` type if the field, constructor, or
method in question carries the `@Autowired` annotation. For more information, see
<<beans-autowired-annotation>>.

When an `ApplicationContext` creates a class that implements the
`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNameAware` interface, the class is provided with
a reference to the name defined in its associated object definition.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface BeanNameAware {

		void setBeanName(string name) throws BeansException;

	}
----

The callback is invoked after population of normal bean properties but before an
initialization callback such as `InitializingBean` __afterPropertiesSet__ or a custom
init-method.



[[aware-list]]
==== Other Aware interfaces

Besides `ApplicationContextAware` and `BeanNameAware` discussed above, Spring offers a
range of `Aware` interfaces that allow beans to indicate to the container that they
require a certain __infrastructure__ dependency. The most important `Aware` interfaces
are summarized below - as a general rule, the name is a good indication of the
dependency type:

[[beans-factory-nature-aware-list]]
.Aware interfaces

| `ApplicationContextAware`
| Declaring `ApplicationContext`
| <<beans-factory-aware>>

| `ApplicationEventPublisherAware`
| Event publisher of the enclosing `ApplicationContext`
| <<context-introduction>>

| `BeanClassLoaderAware`
| Class loader used to load the bean classes.
| <<beans-factory-class>>

| `BeanFactoryAware`
| Declaring `BeanFactory`
| <<beans-factory-aware>>

| `BeanNameAware`
| Name of the declaring bean
| <<beans-factory-aware>>

| `BootstrapContextAware`

| <<mvc>>
|===

Note again that usage of these interfaces ties your code to the Spring API and does not
follow the Inversion of Control style. As such, they are recommended for infrastructure
beans that require programmatic access to the container.
